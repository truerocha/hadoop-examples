This is your new Play application
=================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `activator dist`.

Prerequisites:-

- To run the Play framework, you need JDK 6 or later
- If you are using MacOS 10.10.4, Java is built-in. If you are using Linux, make sure to use either the Sun JDK or OpenJDK (and not gcj, which is the default Java command on many Linux distros).
- Be sure to have the java and javac commands in the current path (you can check this by typing java -version and javac -version at the shell prompt)

Install Activator:-

-Play is distributed through a tool called Typesafe Activator. Typesafe Activator provides the build tool (sbt) that Play is built on, and also provides many templates to help get you started with writing new applications.

-For MacOS:  brew install typesafe-activator
-For Linux(Ubuntu): Download the latest Activator distribution and extract the archive to a location where you have both read and write access,For convenience, you should add the Activator installation directory to your system PATH.
 export PATH=$PATH:/relativePath/to/activator 

Check that the activator command is available:-

-From a shell, launch the activator -help command.

Create a new application with the activator command:-

-The activator command can be used to create a new Play application. Activator allows you to select a template that your new application should be based off
                   (a)  activator new my-first-app
                   (b)  Select the play-scala template
                   (c)  Enter the project name 
                   (d)  Go into Project 
                          -cd Project Name
                   (e)  Run the activator command
                          - activator run
                   (f) Open your browser and type localhost:9000(it will show your home page of play)
